> With the utmost sincerity and honesty, I want to say that I'm absolutely thrilled for this semester's course in Ecology!

Why, you might ask? Because
1. it's an important time in our history to be learning about ecology and
2. we've completely revamped the course, including:

  - a new textbook
  - a new lecture structure
  - 2 of the 5 labs are new
  - 2 of the labs have been completely restructured

Last year the other professor and I were both new hires. That means that we both moved here from other parts of the world (he and I from Rhode Island and Ohio, respectively) and, with a lot of help from the Lab Instructors, organized and carried out this course in Ecology. That was the big experiment: some things worked *really* well and others not so well. Well, this fall it's our first opportunity following significant, meaningful time to work together for nearly a year to design this fall's course! We've put a great deal of blood, sweat, and tears into this course to make this the best course in Ecology that we can.

This post that you're reading will also be an experiment. More specifically, when creating the course website, I desired an outlet to share *additional* information and news for those who are the most interested in the course material. You see, there's a large diversity of student interest in this course, with some interested more in policy, some interested more in general biology, and others are testing the waters to see if ecology is a field in which you have interest. We therefore create the course with 
The course content—as this is a 200-level, introductory course—will be broad and for a genearl audience. To better engage students very interested in ecology, among additional references in lectures, encouragement to attend office hours, and a myriad of other ways that I intend to engage that group, I intend to write posts on ecology and the course. This will likely mostly include news from my lab, news from the department, current events and interesting papers in ecology, or just additional information or elaboration upon a topic in class. tl;dr: I will create posts that are interesting for those who are ecologically oriented.

The course site is pretty standard: the navigation bar includes the syllabus and schedules. But, I included a few things that will might make the site a bit more interesting to use:

- Tags: these are a tool that allows site users to navigate through the website based on indices that I create with every post that I write
- Search: there's a search icon in the navigation bar that will help you find content more easily

That's all for now. I hope that you are as eager as I am to kick off the semester!
