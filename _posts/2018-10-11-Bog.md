In the sixth week of the semester, Ecology Lab students went to the Great Sydney Bog to learn how to classify ecological communities using the the Maine Natural Areas in addition to collect data for a natural experiment looking at plant traits and competition. It rained about 2 cm prior to our visit, but once we arrived the rain cleared up and it was actually a very nice day. In addition to the field trip being many students' first trip to this bizarre ecosystem, many students had a chance to see carnivorous plants (purple pitcher plant, *Sarracenia purpurea* L.) in their natural habitat for the first time! In the bog there were some scattered trees, including black spruce (*Picea mariana* Mill.), tamarack (*Larix laricina* Du Roi), and white pine (*Pinus strobus*). The bog was mostly dominated by ericaceous shrubs, such as sheep laurel (*Kalmia angustifolia* L.), labrador tea (*Ledum groenlandicum* Oeder), and leatherleaf (*Chamaedaphne calyculata* L.). We also munched on some eastern teaberry (*Gaultheria procumbens* L.). It was a mushy day, but it was beautiful out, with cloud cover diffusing the sunlight and the rain washing over the leaves of the plants to reveal the subtle shades of green of each of the species.

Here are a few photos from the trip of students hard at work:

And an action shot of randomly (well, non-random, but rather, haphazard) sampling by tossing the quadrat into the sampling area:
