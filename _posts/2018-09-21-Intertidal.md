In the third week of the semester, Ecology Lab students went to Reid State Park to collect data on how populations change along environmental gradients! Once at the beach, then created a transect perpendicular to the shore, and sampled abiotic conditions (depth from the top of the intertidal zone, temperature, direction the shore is facing) and abundance of two intertidal species (acorn barnales, *Semibalanus balanoides*, and wrack, *Fucus* sp.).

It was a beautiful day out and we enjoyed the gorgeous coast and the other critters we discovered while sampling. These included Double-breasted Cormorants flying in a "V", crabs, hermit crabs, tunicates, periwinkle snails (2 species), dog whelks, collembola, red algae, and green algae among others.

Here are a few photos from the trip of students hard at work:
