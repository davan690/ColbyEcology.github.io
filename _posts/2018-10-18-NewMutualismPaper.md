I am pleased to announce that in the next issue of the journal *Ecography*, I am second author on a research paper. Entitled, [*The mismatch in distributions of vertebrates and the plants that they disperse*](http://mutualismecology.com/Publications/reprints/Dittel_et_al_2018.pdf), the paper is a first in the sense that there have not been thorough, rigorous studies of the distributions of species that engage in mutualisms at large, geographic spatial scales. In this era of masses of digitized data, we decided to take advantage of what we know about species richness of plants and animals, and study the distribution of those plants and animals that engage in seed-dispersal mutualisms. In these mutualisms, plants offer nutrient resources to animals (carbohydrate-rich fuit pulp, fatty nut endosperm) who in turn provide dispersal services (through digestion or caching of seeds).

To out knowledge, there were no *a prior* hypotheses on how the number of species of plants and animals engaged in seed-dispersal mutualisms should be related. We reasoned, however, that we would expect where there are many plant species dispersed by seed-dispersing animals, there would be many seed-dispersing animal species, and vice versa.

We ended up identifying all plants and animals in North America north of Mexico engaged in seed-dispersal mutualisms and compiling data on how many of each were found where. We identified 88 animal species (65 birds and 23 mammals), and [my previous work](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geb.12502) identified 1010 plant species dispersed by fruit-eating mammals and birds (frugivory) and 272 species dispersed by scatter-hoarding rodents and birds.

The most striking discovery we made—that was completely unexpected—was that there is apparently a mismatch in the distributions of om the richness of species engaged in seed dispersal mutualisms:

In the figure above, the left column contains maps of species richness of plants whose seeds are dispersed by animals, the center column contains maps of species richness of animals who disperse plant seeds, and the column on the right contains maps showing the difference between the two. Notice that plant species richness is the greatest in the eastern United States and that animal species richness is the greatest in the south/southwest. This was totally surprising and still perplexing to us.

We hope that this work will encourage others to examine other mutualisms at large spatial scales and attempt to see if this mismatch is the rule or an exception.
