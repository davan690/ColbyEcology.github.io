Fall is such an interesting time for ecology. As most organisms in these temperate regions grow and reproduce in the spring and summer, the fall is the time of year when they die and leave behind offspring to grow next spring or go dormant to some extent. In the case of many of the common, large woody plants, like the red maple (*Acer rubrum*), they wind down photosynthesis and eventually shed their leaves. The intermediate metamorphosis (figuritively) results in the incredibly vibrant colors that we associate with fall in the region:

As this is my second fall here in New England, I have come to not only love the fall foliage, but also a more subtle aspect of the seasonâ€”the fruiting bodies of fungi. In this area, especially with the annual shedding of leaves, there is an enormous amount of litter and other organic matter that finds their way to the forest floor. And with all of the build up comes those organisms who can feed upon it. Of course there are a multitude of insects and other invertebrate animals that partake in the feast, but the fungi are really the ones who take home the decomposition cake. The interstice of soil and roots in these forests are teeming with fungi. During fall, many different fungi release their offspring (called spores) above ground to disperse and give their offspring a chance to establish in a rich patch of resources. The fruiting bodies that project through the Earth, above ground are commonly called mushrooms, with each one containing thousands or millions of spores. The fireworks of mushrooms on the forest floors can be as magnificent as the foliage up above. Here are a few fungi I was able to see on a walk this weekend in the arboretum:

Much like fungi, many plants also produce seeds to be dispersed in the fall. Here, I captured a photo of eastern teaberry (*Gaultheria procumbens*):

And alas, some plants, such as the goldenrod below (*Solidago* sp.) are still flowering in an attempt to be pollinated (in this case, by the eastern bumblebee, *Bombus impatiens*) and set seed before the wet winter weather hits and it dies:
