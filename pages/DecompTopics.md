# Decomposition experiment topics


- Decomposition's role in the carbon feedback loop: [Temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition and feedbacks to climate change
](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04514)
- The effect of temperature on decomposition: [Experimental warming shows that decomposition temperature sensitivity increases with soil organic matter recalcitrance](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/08-0137.1)
- The effect of moisture on decomposition
- The role of fungi in decomposition
- The role of bacteria and invertebrates in decomposition
- The effect of litter quality and chemical composition on decomposition
- Fluctuating environments and decomposition
- How decomposition changes over time (labile and recalcitrant biomass)
- How we model decomposition
