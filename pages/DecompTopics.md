# Decomposition experiment topics

For the decomposition experiment presentations, I ask to inform your presentation that you use the paper linked to your topic below and *at least* two others.

Not included in the three papers required above, here is a link to the paper that we based this experiment on: [Tea Bag Index: a novel approach to collect uniform decomposition data across ecosystems](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12097)
