| Decomposition's role in the carbon feedback loop | [Temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition and feedbacks to climate change](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04514) |
| The effect of temperature on decomposition | [Experimental warming shows that decomposition temperature sensitivity increases with soil organic matter recalcitrance](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/08-0137.1) |
| The effect of moisture on decomposition [Edge effects on moisture reduce wood decomposition rate in a temperate forest](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.12676) |
| The role of fungi in decomposition | [https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2435.12677](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2435.12677) |
| The role of bacteria and invertebrates in decomposition | [Plant Diversity Impacts Decomposition and Herbivory via Changes in Aboveground Arthropods](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0106529) |
