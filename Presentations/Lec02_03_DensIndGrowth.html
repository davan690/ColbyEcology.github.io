## Continuous and discrete time
### Continous
* Variables in the model change all of the time
* Generations are *overlapping*
* There is no inherent delay between "events"
* No built-in periodicity (e.g., seasonality)

--

### Discrete
* Variables in the model change at predefined, constant increments
* Generations can be *non-overlapping*
* There is a delay between "events"
* Commonly used for periodic (e.g., seasonal) systems
---

## Parts of dynamical models
### State variables: change over time
* Examples in non-ecological models include: concentration, position, temperature, current, allele frequency, GDP
* Examples in ecological models include: abundance, density, position, yield, resource concentration
--

***
### Parameters: constants that generally don't change over time
* Examples in non-ecological models: slection coefficients, distance, viscosity, mutation, decay
* Examples in ecological models: births, deaths, strength of density dependence, sign (e.g., predators always have a - effect on prey)
---

## General anatomy of a dynamical model
### State variable(s)
* For this course, we are focused on abundance or density, commonly abbreviated as `\(N\)`
* Time will be abbreviated as `\(t\)`

--

### Generally
$$ \frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t} = f(N) $$
--

#### Some conventions
* For discrete-time models we use `\(N_t\)`
* For continuous-time models we use `\(N(t)\)`. Although for this class, and generally throughout the ecological literature (including in the book), we simply write `\(N\)`

---
## Anatomy of a dynamical model: discrete time
* General dyanmic model
$$f(N) = \frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t} = $$
--

* Geometric growth: constant growth, discrete time 
`$$N_{t+1} = N_t + RN_t$$`

--

* Writing a function in `R`

```r
geom.growth &lt;- function(Nt, R) {
* Nt1 &lt;- Nt + R*Nt
  return(Nt1)
}
```

--

* An example with `\(N_t = 1\)` and `\(R = 0.1\)`:

```r
geom.growth(Nt = 1, R = 0.1)
```

```
## [1] 1.1
```

---
## Anatomy of a dynamical model: continuous time
* General dyanmic model
$$f(N) = \frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t} = $$
--

* Geometric growth: constant growth, discrete time 
`$$\frac{dN}{dt} = rN$$`

--
* Writing a function in `R`

```r
exp.growth &lt;- function(Nft, r) {
*  dNdt &lt;- r*Nft
  return(dNdt)
}
```

--
* An example with `\(N = 1\)` and `\(r = 0.1\)`:

```r
exp.growth(Nft = 1, r = 0.1)
```

```
## [1] 0.1
```


---
## Continuous and discrete time (with equations)
### Continous
* Variables in the model change all of the time
* Generations are *overlapping*
* There is no inherent delay between "events"
* No built-in seasonality
`$$\frac{dN}{dt} = f(N)$$`

--

### Discrete
* Variables in the model change at predefined, constant increments
* Generations can be *non-overlapping*
* There is a delay between "events"
* Commonly used for periodic (e.g., seasonal) systems
$$ N_{t+1} = N_t + f(N_t) $$

# Analyze it!: Find long-term behavior, determine behavior if perturbed, make predictions
Not too much happening with this simple, linear model:
* Long-term behavior: continues to grow or shrink at a constant rate
* Determinted behavior if perturbed: continues to grow or shrink at a constant rate
* Make predictions: continues to grow or shrink at a constant rate

# Births and deaths as separate processes

* Each density-indpendent model makes the assumption that `\(r\)` is unchangingâ€”is this a reasonable assumption? Discuss and justify.

--

* In the beginning of the chapter there was a leitmotif on the maximum number of individuals that can exist before the next one squishes all of them to death. Out of my own morbid curiosity, please continue to work in paris and figure out (1) what the maximum human population can be and (2) how long it will take for humans to reach that point using the following data and a discrete model of growth?

# A note about a subsumption of *r*
### *r* is the difference between births and deaths

--

Specific to our discrete-time density-independent models, this means:
`$$N_{t+1} = N_t + RN_t = N_t + BN_t - DN_t$$`

--

And the solution would be:
`$$N_t = N_0(1 + B - D)^t$$`

--

Specific to our continous-time density-independent models, this means:
`$$\frac{dN}{dt} = rN = (b-d)N$$`

--

And the solution would be:
`$$N(t) = N(0)e^{t(b - d)}$$`
