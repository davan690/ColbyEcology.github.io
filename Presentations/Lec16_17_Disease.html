# Variety of disease models

There are many different models of disease dynamics, given the *enormous* diversity of pathogen, vector, and host life histories. (Notice that we are only considering the dynamics of the host and not the pathogen.)

As some examples:

--

I. Susceptibles become infected, and remain infected for their lives

--

II. Susceptibles become infected, fight off the disease, and again become susceptible

--

III. Susceptibles become infected, fight off the disease, and become resistant to subsequent infection

--

IV. Some diseases include a latent period before making the infected infectious

--

V. Some diseases can exist post-infected "carriers" that are no longer harmed, but can be indefinitely infectious

--

VI. Some diseases are maternally inherited

--

VII. Some diseases include vectors

As some examples:

I. Susceptibles become infected, and remain infected for their lives (**SI model**)

II. Susceptibles become infected, fight off the disease, and again become susceptible (**SIS model**)

III. Susceptibles become infected, fight off the disease, and become resistant to subsequent infection (**SIR model**)

IV. Some diseases include a latent period before making the infected infectious (**SEIR model**)

V. Some diseases can exist post-infected "carriers" that are no longer harmed, but can be indefinitely infectious (**Carrier state model**)

VI. Some diseases are maternally inherited (**MSI, MSIR, etc. model**)

VII. Some diseases include vectors

# Susceptible-infected (SI) model

The simplest disease model includes 2 state variables to represent a **s**usceptible portion of the population and an **i**nfected portion of the population.

--

First, let's assume that the host popualtion is *constant* over time. We can generally write down a system of equations to describe the dynamics:

--

`$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{dS}{dt} &amp;= f_1(S, I) \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &amp;= f_2(S, I)
\end{aligned}$$`

--

But also describe the simplest form with a transmission coefficient representing the probability that an infected contacts a susceptible and be transmitted:

`$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{dS}{dt} &amp;= -\beta SI \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &amp;= \beta SI
\end{aligned}$$`

---
# Susceptible-infected (SI) model

Let's exame the effect of transmission coefficient, `\(\beta\)` on disease dynaimcs. Graphically solve the model with different values of `\(\beta\)` and plot your results of infecteds as a times series with different values of `\(\beta\)` on the graph.

`$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{dS}{dt} &amp;= -\beta SI \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &amp;= \beta SI
\end{aligned}$$`

---
# Susceptible-infected (SI) model

```r
SI &lt;- function(t, y, parameters) {
	S &lt;- y[1]
	I &lt;- y[2]
	beta &lt;- parameters[1]
	dS &lt;- -beta*S*I
	dI &lt;- beta*S*I
	return(list(c(dS, dI)))
}
SI.init &lt;- c(S = 0.99, I = 0.01)
SI.times &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 25, by = 0.1)
betas &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.05)
cols &lt;- colorRampPalette(c("red", "blue"))(length(betas))
for (i in 1:length(betas)){
  SI.parms &lt;- c(beta = betas[i])
  SI.out &lt;- ode(y = SI.init, times = SI.times, func = SI, parms = SI.parms)
  if (i == 1) {
      plot(x = SI.out[,1], y = SI.out[,3], ylim = c(0, 1), type = "l", col = cols[i])	
    } else {
    	lines(x = SI.out[,1], y = SI.out[,3], col = cols[i])
    }
}
```

# Susceptible-infected (SI) model

Notice that we are working in *proportion of a constant population*. This means `\(S\)` can be expressed in terms of `\(I\)` and vice versa becuase `\(N = S + I\)`, AND we are setting `\(N = 1\)`. This means that `\(1 = S + I\)`.

--

In terms of our equation, that means we can substitute for `\(S\)` or `\(I\)` and solve. This is done as eq. 1 in the book that shows that
`$$\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta SI$$`
can be written as
`$$\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta I(1 - I)$$`

--

That's logistic!

# Susceptible-infected (SI) model
With vital rates, where `\(\mu\)` is the birth rate and `\(\nu\)` is the death rate.

`$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{dS}{dt} &amp;= \mu N -\frac{\beta SI}{N} - \nu S \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &amp;= \frac{\beta SI}{N}- \nu I
\end{aligned}$$`

--

Notice that the death rate is the same for susceptibles and infecteds. We could also include an infedted death rate. E.g., 

`$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{dS}{dt} &amp;= \mu N -\frac{\beta SI}{N} - \nu S \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &amp;= \frac{\beta SI}{N}- \gamma I
\end{aligned}$$`

---
# Susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model

We now add a state variable for a portion of the population who has **r**ecovered from being infected.

--

We also need to add a parameter for the rate of recovery; let's say `\(v\)`.

--

`$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{dS}{dt} &amp;= -\beta SI \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &amp;= \beta SI - vI \\
\frac{dR}{dt} &amp;= vI
\end{aligned}$$`

# Susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model
Vandermeer and Goldberg describe the significance of the relationship between the two important paramters, recovery and transmission rates, `\(v\)` and `\(\beta\)`, respectively.

--

From the SI model, `\(\frac{v}{\beta}\)` was a critical ratio that determined wether the equilibrium for infecteds will be 0 or 1.

--

In the SIR model, the `\(I\)` derivative can be arranged algebraically where `\(\frac{\beta}{v}\)` acts as a threshold as to wether the infected portion will increase or decline. It's realted to `\(R_0\)`, a universal parameter known as the **the basic reproductive ratio** defined as *the average number of secondary infected cases  arising from an average primary case in an entirely susceptible population*. In other words, it's the rate of infection per recovery rate.

--

Create a time series for an SIR model. Pretend the suscetible population is Colby (roughly 2000 people on campus) and one person returns from winter break with a pathogen that is transmitted with a probability of 0.5. Create a time series to show how the infected Mules change over time for recovery rates both of 0.1 and 0.5. What and when are the peaks (maximim `\(I\)`) for each?

---
# Susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model
`\(I\)` is the red line and `\(v = 0.1\)`:
