# Exercises based on Vandermeer and Goldberg
**Due 23 March 2018**

### 5.14
Remoras are small fish that hang around on the surface of sharks and feed off the remains of whatever the sharks eat. Frequently a givern shark can have a large number of these fish on its surface, but sometimes individual sharks have none. The only way a remora can get from one shark to another is when the sharks come in contact with one another (or get close to one another). If 25% of the individuals in a particular shark population have remoras, what is the probability that a shark encounter will result in the transfer of a remora from an occupied to an unoccupied shark? (Thik of the contact processâ€”what is in contact with what and what needs to happen for an unoccupied shark to become occupied.)

### 5.15
Repeat exercise 5.14 but with the additional knowledge that every time one shark encounters another, there is a 50% chance that a remora (if present) will change sharks. What then will be the probability that a shark encounter would result in the transfer of remoras from an occupied to an unoccupied shark? (Don't oever think this one either.)

### 5.16
Let the proportion of sharks with remoras be equal to $p$ and the probability of a remora transfering between two sharks in contact be $m$. If that rate of change of the proportion of sharks occupied is take to be equal to the probability of transfer upon contact, write the general equation for that rate of change, in cnotinuous time.

### 5.17
Graphically show the general relationship between $p^*$ (vertical axis) and $e$ (horizontal axis) for values of $m$. Begin with $m = 1$, then add lines to your plot for additional values of $m$, say, by decreasing it by 0.1 intervals until $m = 0.1$.

$$p^* = \frac{m-e}{m}$$


### 5.18
Some populations may behave as metapopulations in the sense that there is a discontinuous distribution of individuals in space and a constant extinction rate of those patches, but the migration rate is independent of the proportion of habitatas occupied (sometimes referred to as propagule rain). Presume that there is zero migration from patch to patch but there is a constant rain of individuals from outside the system. What would the equation for this situation be? What would the equilibrium value be? Graph the equilibrium as a function of the extinction rate (for propagule rain = 0.25), and compare it with the Levins metapopulation equation (final equation on pge 145).
