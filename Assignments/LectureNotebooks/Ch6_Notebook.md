# Exercises based on Vandermeer and Goldberg
**Due 09 April 2018**

This Notebook will help familiarize you with the different types of qualitative dynamics of mostly predator-prey and consumer-resource models, but also a few others. Essentially, I am asking you to make a time series, a phase plane, and find the nullclines for different models. Although we are just learning them in week 7, we will be studying them in more depth weeks 8 through 10.

**You probably want to suppress the output of the `phaseR` functions. Although there are different ways of doing this, the simplest way is probably to assign the function to an object. E.g., `a <- nullclines(...)` or `a <- flowField(...)` will still plot (what you want) but the text output will be saved and not printed to your Knitted output.**

### 6A
#### Neutralism
Plot a time series, phase plane, and describe the 4 nullclines for a case of neutralism.

### 6B
#### Amensalism
Plot a time series, phase plane, and describe the 4 nullclines for a case of amensalism.

### 6C
#### Comensalism
Plot a time series, phase plane, and describe the 4 nullclines for a case of Comensalism.

### 6D
#### Predator-prey/consumer-resource, I
Plot a time series, phase plane, and describe the 4 nullclines for a predator-prey model where each species is govererned by logistic dynamics (i.e., an extension of the above).

### 6E
#### Predator-prey/consumer-resource, II
Plot a time series, phase plane, and describe the 4 nullclines for a predator-prey model where prey grow exponentially and predators die constantly (i.e., equation 3 from V&G).

### 6F
#### Predator-prey/consumer-resource, III
Plot a time series, phase plane, and describe the 4 nullclines for a predator-prey model where prey grow logistically and predators die constantly (i.e., equation 6 from V&G).
